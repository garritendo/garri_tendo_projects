dear onlooker.thank you for stopping by. i have some projects that may not be big to u, but are big to me
of all my codes in my repository, the one i am very interested in is the number to words conversion.
i cannot get my head around the ability to convert integers into their word formats. eg, 150 converted as one hundred and fifty
